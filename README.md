# agilemodel
My project is a simple calculator using Python. The calculator is based on agile model that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The "calculator" function performs the necessary arithmetic operation given two numbers, an operator, and input. Without needing to restart the software, the user can carry out several calculations using the while loop. The software also deals with mistakes like division by zero and improper operators. The calculator is built on Scrum Framework.The calculator is developed using python. You will be needing only python to run this script. Running the script is simple. Open the visual studio code, go to terminal in the folder where your script is located and run the following command 'python agile.py'. When you run the code, you will encounter with the design of the calculator. Close the window of the output. Then, you will find the commands in the terminal for execution. Please have a look at agile.py for the program code.
